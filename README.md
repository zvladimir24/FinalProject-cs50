#### Video Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFYwpSxpEKg
#### Description: Web application for my final project using django framework, and django REST for api, its similar to the web app the we worked on in week 8 called finance. For this project i used Django framework insted of flask and i also created my own api using Django REST framework. Just like for finance app i used bootstrap to style Django tamplates, the app itself is not too complicated or visualy great, but its funcional. The project was very interesting, learining how Django handels datebase through models.py urls and views compared to flask. Overall i think this project is good enough for a rookie.
